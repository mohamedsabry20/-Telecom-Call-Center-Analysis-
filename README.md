# -Telecom-Call-Center-Analysis-
## Overview

#### This dashboard represents the Inbound Call data for a top telecom client. The primary challenge is the reduction of High AHT (Average Handle Time) and Hold Time across various locations, skills, workgroups, and batches
## Problem

#### The problem is that there is a high Average Handling Time (AHT) and excessive use of the Hold function in the call center for a top telecom client. These issues negatively impact the customer experience and may indicate challenges in call management or customer support processes.
## Solution

#### -Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the inbound call data to understand patterns and trends related to AHT and Hold usage.
#### -Segment the data by different workgroups to identify which teams or units are contributing to higher AHT and Hold times.
## Recommendations for Reducing AHT & Hold Time

### 1-Location-Specific Coaching:
#### *Focus on regions like Al-Qassim, which have the highest AHT and Hold Time. Implement specific coaching and support for these areas.
### 2-Skill-Based Training:

### 4-Experience-Level Training:
#### *Focus on providing additional training for fresh and beginner employees to enhance their efficiency and lower both AHT and Hold Time.
### 5-Process Optimization for Experienced Workers:
#### *For experienced employees, review workflows to further reduce Hold Time, even with high efficiency in AHT.
